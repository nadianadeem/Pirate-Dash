## Pirate Dash

**Project description:** Pirate Dash is the a university assignment that I did in my first semester at university. Pirate Dash is a two player game where 2 boats are trying survive the seas by dodging obstacles and gaining coins to increase their score. The players can shoot at each other by picking up cannon balls. If a player is hit by an obstacle or a cannon ball they lose health and possibly a life, if a player dies before the time is up, their opponent wins. The players have 10 minutes to get as many coins as they can the person who has the highest score wins.
